# Apollo's Labyrinth
This game is brought to you by Team HISSS.

You will be teleported to Greece during the ancient times when man lived under the breath of Zeus and worshipped the Olympian
Gods as part of daily life. This very moment, the city of Athens is feeling the wrath of Zeus. Apollo, the God of Sun, archery, music, prophecy and healing, has been punished for the third time, to be banished to Ogygia until only Zeus deems it not to be. With this, the prophecies have been obstructed and sickness is felling through the cities of Greece. The final prophecy, coming from the ancient woods of Dadona, was "Seek the sire of the Sun, let him qwell the flames of Helios, strike the head of the slythering one, and take back the seat at Delhpi."

Born among the peasants, you are shocked to hear the words that have been spoken by your mother on her death bed, "Your father is Apollo". Now it is your time to fight the way through the horrors that wait in the labyrinth.
